## 📑 Course Curriculum

### [Module 1: Basics of Generative AI]()

An introduction to the core concepts of generative models. Understand the shift from traditional AI to Generative AI, how Transformers work, and the current landscape of the industry.

### [Module 2: Basics of Prompt Engineering]()

Learn the "language of AI." This module covers how to craft effective prompts, 
understanding the difference between good and bad outputs, and fundamental techniques 
like **Chain of Thought** and **ReAct**.

### [Module 3: Advanced Generative AI Concepts]()

Dive deeper into the technical architecture. Topics include:

* Fine-tuning vs. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).
* Vector databases and embeddings.
* Orchestration frameworks (e.g., LangChain or LlamaIndex).

### [Module 4: Security and Ethics in Generative AI]()

Explore the critical "guardrails" of AI development.

* **Security:** Preventing prompt injections and data leakage.
* **Ethics:** Addressing bias, toxicity, and copyright concerns.
* **Governance:** Responsible AI frameworks.

### [Module 5: Use Cases of Generative AI]()

Practical applications across industries. We analyze how GenAI is transforming software development (coding assistants), content creation, customer support, and data analysis.

### [Module 6: EPAM Proposition]()

A deep dive into EPAM's specific accelerators, tools, and strategic approach to delivering GenAI solutions for global clients. Learn about the **EPAM DIAL** platform and our implementation methodology.

### [Module 7: Gen AI vs. Machine Learning]()

A comparative analysis to help you choose the right tool for the job. Understand when to use a massive LLM and when a traditional, supervised Machine Learning model is more efficient, cost-effective, and accurate.
