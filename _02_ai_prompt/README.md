# Prompt Engineering - AI Architect Module 2.1

Welcome to the **Prompt Engineering** module. This repository/chapter focuses on the art and science of communicating with Large Language Models (LLMs). Understanding how to talk to an LLM is critical, as the quality of your prompts directly shapes the results of your application.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will understand:

* The fundamental importance of Prompt Engineering.
* The key differences between effective and ineffective prompts.
* Advanced reasoning techniques to improve LLM output accuracy and reliability.

## 🛠 Core Prompting Techniques (Mandatory)

This module covers the essential strategies required to build robust AI applications.

### 1. Tips and Tricks for Prompt Engineering

Learn the foundational "Dos and Don'ts," including being specific, providing context, and defining the desired output format to reduce hallucinations.

### 2. Chain of Thoughts (CoT) Technique

An explanation of the "Chain of Thoughts" approach, which encourages the model to show its work. By breaking down complex problems into intermediate steps, the LLM can solve logical tasks more accurately.

### 3. Tree of Thoughts (ToT) Technique

An evolution of CoT, the "Tree of Thoughts" allows the model to explore multiple reasoning paths simultaneously, look ahead, and backtrack when necessary to solve complex problems.

### 4. ReAct Technique

Learn the **Reason + Act** method. This technique combines reasoning traces with task-specific actions, allowing the LLM to interact with external tools or environments to gather information before providing a final answer.

### 5. Meta Prompts

An introduction to Meta Prompting—the process of using an LLM to help design, 
create, or optimize other prompts.

### 6. Prompt Engineering Toolbox

An overview of the essential tools and frameworks available to streamline the prompt engineering workflow and manage prompt versions.
